# Overview of the Rembulan compiler

Rembulan compiles Lua sources directly to Java bytecode. In contrast to PUC-Lua,
which first compiles Lua sources to the Lua bytecode (that is then interpreted),
the intermediate representation used in the Rembulan compiler is not exposed to
the users, and has no serialisable format.

This means that on the binary level, Rembulan is not compatible with PUC-Lua. On the
other hand, however, it allows the compiler to perform some optimisations static
analysis more easily.

The main class of the compiler is
[`compiler.dev.foxgirl.rembulan.LuaCompiler`](https://github.com/luavixen/rembulan/blob/main/rembulan-compiler/src/main/java/dev/foxgirl/rembulan/compiler/LuaCompiler.java)
in the `rembulan-compiler` module.

## Basics

Every Lua chunk is compiled to one or more classes that extend
[`LuaFunction`](https://luavixen.github.io/rembulan/apidocs/rembulan-runtime/dev/foxgirl/rembulan/runtime/LuaFunction.html),
i.e., every resulting class corresponds to a Lua function in the source. Nested functions
are treated analogously to static nested classes in Java.

Function upvalues are represented as *fields* of the type
[`Variable`](https://luavixen.github.io/rembulan/apidocs/rembulan-runtime/dev/foxgirl/rembulan/Variable.html); the number
of upvalues a function has determines the form of its constructor.

## Optimisations

Rembulan performs basic static analysis of the Lua programs in order to simplify the
generated code, and eliminate unnecessary guards against possible metamethod calls.
This is important since the [coroutine implementation](HowAreCoroutinesImplemented.md)
used in Rembulan requires Lua functions that perform calls to be ready to be paused,
and generating such code makes the bytecode longer and makes its control flow graph more
complex. This in turn makes the JVM less likely to optimise the JIT-ed bytecode.  

What follows is a description of optimisation steps performed by the compiler,
done in a loop until a fixed point is reached.

**Note:** CPU accounting is not influenced by the optimisation steps. An optimised version of
a compiled function will still clock in the same number as a plain, unoptimised one.

#### Type analysis

In the majority of cases, whether a Lua operation *op* may involve a metamethod call
depends on the *types* of the operands of *op*.
(See 
[ยง2.4 of the Lua Reference Manual](http://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html#2.4).)
For instance, the expression

```lua
x + y
```  
    
may trigger a metamethod call, unless `x` and `y` are `number`s or `string`s that can
be converted to numbers. It then follows that if we know that both `x` and `y` are `number`s,
we can generate bytecode for numerical addition immediately, and we also know
that the type of the expression `(x + y)` will be `number`.

Type analysis of course also works in conjunction with control flow analysis.
Suppose we have the following snippet:
 
```lua 
local x
if condition then
  x = a + b
else
  x = 0
end  
```

Here, the type of the value of the local variable `x` after the `if` statement will depend
on the types of `a` and `b` (and the value of `condition`, see below). Let us look at the possible
cases:
   
  * if `a` and `b` are `integer`s (a subtype of `number`), then `x` will be an `integer`;
  * otherwise, if `a` and `b` are `number`s, then `x` will be a `number`;
  * otherwise, `x` will be `any` (a supertype of all types).    

In the first two cases, we do not have to emit the code that may need to handle
metamethods (and, by extension, coroutine switches), so this code does not introduce an
additional entry point. Additionally, in the first case, we even have enough information to keep
`a`, `b` and `x` unboxed.
(**Note:** this step is not done yet.)

#### Branch inlining

Now, suppose that `condition` is always `false` or `nil`. In that case, we can skip
the `then`-branch entirely, and know that the type of `x` after the `if` statement
is `integer` (with the value `0`).

Relevant class: [`tf.compiler.dev.foxgirl.rembulan.BranchInliner`](https://github.com/luavixen/rembulan/blob/main/rembulan-compiler/src/main/java/dev/foxgirl/rembulan/compiler/tf/BranchInliner.java)

#### Const folding

Constant values are treated as literal types. I.e., constant propagation is treated
as part of the type inference step.

In the example above, if we know statically the *values* of `a` and `b`, we can compute
the result of `(a + b)` at compile-time, and use it as the type of the expression.
The actual "addition" can then be safely removed from the IR representation of the function.
(This is only true for operations that do not have any side-effects.)

#### Dead code elimination

Suppose we execute the snippet above, but never use the value of `x`. In that case,
we do not need to keep `x` around, and if the expression `(a + b)` cannot trigger a metamethod
call, we do not even need to evaluate it.
This is done by computing the liveness of all variables (and temporary values),
and pruning out dead code based on this information.

Relevant classes:
* [`analysis.compiler.dev.foxgirl.rembulan.LivenessAnalyser`](https://github.com/luavixen/rembulan/blob/main/rembulan-compiler/src/main/java/dev/foxgirl/rembulan/compiler/analysis/LivenessAnalyser.java)
* [`tf.compiler.dev.foxgirl.rembulan.DeadCodePruner`](https://github.com/luavixen/rembulan/blob/main/rembulan-compiler/src/main/java/dev/foxgirl/rembulan/compiler/tf/DeadCodePruner.java)

## Code generation

Once a function has been optimised, it is compiled into Java bytecode. This involves several
steps, and takes into account the type and liveness information computed during optimisation
passes.

#### Slot allocation

Slot allocation uses the liveness information to come up with a mapping from variables
and temporary values to local variables in the resulting bytecode, similar to registers
in PUC-Lua. The slots are untyped (i.e, their type is `java.lang.Object`) in order to
enable slot sharing. As a consequence, values that have equivalent primitive JVM types
(i.e., Lua integers are `long`s, Lua floats are `doubles`, and Lua booleans are `boolean`s)
need to be boxed.

**Note:** this is likely to change in future versions, since boxing is a significant
performance drag, and can in fact be removed rather easily at this point.

Relevant class: [`analysis.compiler.dev.foxgirl.rembulan.SlotAllocator`](https://github.com/luavixen/rembulan/blob/main/rembulan-compiler/src/main/java/dev/foxgirl/rembulan/compiler/analysis/SlotAllocator.java)

#### Code generation

Code generation takes the slot information along with type information, and walks the
IR graph, generating Java bytecode in the process. Long methods may need to be segmented
into multiple nested methods (to avoid the 64kB limit on the size of a method in Java
bytecode), wires up the methods so as to implement `LuaFunction`, and generates the
resulting Java classfile as a byte array.

This step uses the ASM framework.

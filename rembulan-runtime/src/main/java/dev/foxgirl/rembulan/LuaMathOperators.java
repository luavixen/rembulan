/**
 * A collection of static methods for performing the equivalents of Lua's arithmetic,
 * bitwise and numerical comparison operations.
 *
 * <p>This class and its methods exploits the isomorphism between Lua integers and
 * Java {@code long} on the one hand, and between Lua floats and Java {@code double}
 * on the other.</p>
 *
 * <p>For each operation, there are as many variants in the form of a static method
 * as there are valid type combinations. While all arithmetic operations
 * are defined in two variants (for two {@code long}s and two {@code double}s, e.g.
 * {@link #idiv(long, long)} and {@link #idiv(double, double)}), bitwise operations
 * have single variants (taking two {@code long}s, e.g. {@link #band(long, long)}),
 * and numerical comparison operations have four variants (for argument type combination).</p>
 *
 * <p>It is the task of a Lua implementation to select the appropriate method and
 * supply it with the required values; however, note that the method selection is well-behaved
 * under the type conversion rules of the Java programming language.</p>

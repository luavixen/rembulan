/**
 * A throwable used for non-local control flow changes, containing an incomplete
 * (<i>unresolved</i>) Lua call stack without the bottom-most frame.
 *
 * <p>When suspending a call, the runtime uses the exception handling mechanism of the
 * Java Virtual Machine to unravel the (Java) call stack and while doing so, to build
 * a representation of the Lua call stack for a later resume. This throwable is an essential
 * part of this mechanism.</p>
 *
 * <p>An {@code UnresolvedControlThrowable} contains an incomplete call stack, missing the
 * bottom-most call frame. In order to <i>resolve</i> the control throwable, a call frame must
 * be attached by calling the method {@link #resolve(Resumable, Object)}, and the resulting
 * {@code ResolvedControlThrowable} must be thrown. When this process is repeated on every
 * level of the Lua call stack all the way down to the entry point, a full Lua call stack
 * representation will be built.</p>
 *
 * <p>Consequently, <b>this throwable should never be ignored</b>. Doing so would prevent
 * both the non-local control change (i.e., the suspend) and the construction of the Lua call
 * stack.</p>
 *
 * <p>Instances of this class are immutable and do not contain Java stack traces for performance
 * reasons.</p>

/**
 * A throwable used for non-local control flow changes, containing a complete
 * (<i>resolved</i>) Lua call stack information all the way to the stack top.
 *
 * <p>When suspending a call, the runtime uses the exception handling mechanism of the
 * Java Virtual Machine to unravel the (Java) call stack and while doing so, to build
 * a representation of the Lua call stack for a later resume. This throwable is an essential
 * part of this mechanism.</p>
 *
 * <p>In contrast to {@link UnresolvedControlThrowable}, a {@code ResolvedControlThrowable}
 * contains a complete representation of the Lua call stack that can be used to resume
 * the call. In order to unravel the entire Lua call stack up to the entry
 * point of the call, <b>this throwable should never be caught without being rethrown</b>.
 * Doing so would prevent both the non-local control change (i.e., the suspend) and the
 * construction of the remainder of the Lua call stack.</p>
 *
 * <p>Instances of this class are immutable and do not contain Java stack traces for performance
 * reasons.</p>

	 * Resumes this protected resumable in the given execution context {@code context},

	 * <b>This method throws a {@link ResolvedControlThrowable}</b>:
	 * this method is expected to have resolved non-local control changes up to the point
	 * of its invocation.
	 *
	 * <p>This method is called by the call executor when resuming a previously suspended
	 * protected function call while unrolling the call stack after an error has occurred.
	 * The error, passed in the {@code error} argument, may be {@code null}.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>As with {@link Resumable#resume(ExecutionContext, Object)}, the execution context
	 * {@code context} may differ from the execution context used before, and {@code suspendedState}
	 * is guaranteed by the executor to be <i>equivalent</i> to the suspended state registered
	 * by the call to {@link UnresolvedControlThrowable#resolve(Resumable, Object)}. Equivalence here
	 * means that the class will be equal to that of the state object previously registered;
	 * however, the actual instance passed to this method may be a clone or a (serialised
	 * and) de-serialised version of the original object.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>Implementations of this method may safely assume that {@code context} is not
	 * {@code null}.</p>

	 * @param suspendedState  suspended state, equivalent to the suspended state registered
	 *                        with the call executor
	 * @param error  error object, may be {@code null}
	 *
	 * @throws ResolvedControlThrowable  if the resumed call initiates a non-local control change

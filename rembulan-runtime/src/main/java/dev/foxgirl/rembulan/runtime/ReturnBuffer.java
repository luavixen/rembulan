/**
 * A buffer used to store and retrieve the results of function calls and Lua operations
 * initiated via the {@link Dispatch} methods.
 *
 * <p>In Lua, a function may return either a sequence of values, or a tail call
 * of another Lua function. A return buffer represents both possibilities as an optional
 * call target (for tail calls), and mandatory sequence of values (for tail calls, these
 * are the call arguments; for plain returns, these are the actual values).</p>
 *
 * <p>To query the length of the sequence, use {@link #size()}. To access the values, use
 * {@link #getAsArray()} to get the entire sequence packed into an array, {@link #get(int)}
 * to get a single value in the sequence (or {@code null} when the index is not between 0
 * (inclusive) and {@code size()} (exclusive), or {@link #get0()}, {@link #get1()}, ...
 * for possibly more optimised versions of {@code get(int)}.</p>
 *
 * <p>To determine whether the return buffer contains a tail call, the method {@link #isCall()}
 * may be used; when it returns {@code true}, then the call target (i.e. the object to
 * be tail-called) is accessible using {@link #getCallTarget()}.</p>
 *
 * <p>New return buffer instances may be created using the methods provided by the static
 * factory class {@link ReturnBuffers}.</p>
